# This script monitors the battery status and sends notifications to the user
# It keeps track of whether the user has acknowledged high battery state notifications so they are only shown once
# Low charge notififications on the other hand are sent every time the script runs if the battery is low

# ------------ Variables ------------

# 1. Look for the system battery device path
BATTERY_PATH=$(upower -e | grep battery)

# CRITICAL FIX FOR DESKTOPS: If no battery device path is found by upower,
# instantly exit the script cleanly before logging or checking values.
